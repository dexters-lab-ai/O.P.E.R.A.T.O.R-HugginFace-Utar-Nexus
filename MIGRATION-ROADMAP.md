# OPERATOR Modernization Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for modernizing the OPERATOR application architecture. We'll tackle this in phases, each with specific tasks and goals.

## Phase 1: Foundation Preparation

### 1.1 Modern Build Pipeline
- [x] Fix immediate issues with module loading (add type="module" to script tags)
- [ ] Complete Vite configuration for frontend
  - [ ] Update vite.config.js for proper module resolution
  - [ ] Configure build optimization settings
  - [ ] Set up environment variables handling
- [ ] Add TypeScript support
  - [ ] Create tsconfig.json
  - [ ] Add type definitions for existing libraries
  - [ ] Configure build tools for TS processing
- [ ] Update ESLint and Prettier configuration
  - [ ] Add modern JS/TS rules
  - [ ] Configure for consistent code style

### 1.2 Code Organization
- [ ] Restructure frontend code into domains
  - [ ] Create folders for each feature domain
  - [ ] Separate view logic from business logic
  - [ ] Define clear module boundaries and exports
- [ ] Create utilities folder for shared functionality
  - [ ] Move helper functions to dedicated files
  - [ ] Establish naming conventions
- [ ] Document folder structure and organization principles

### 1.3 State Management
- [ ] Implement lightweight state management
  - [ ] Select and integrate state management library
  - [ ] Create stores for application state
  - [ ] Document state flow patterns
- [ ] Refactor global variables into state stores
  - [ ] Identify all global state
  - [ ] Migrate to managed state
  - [ ] Add proper subscriptions for reactivity

## Phase 2: Component Isolation

### 2.1 Component Library Foundation
- [ ] Select component framework
  - [ ] Evaluate options (Lit, Preact, Alpine.js, etc.)
  - [ ] Create proof of concept with core components
  - [ ] Document decision and rationale
- [ ] Create base UI components
  - [ ] Buttons, inputs, cards
  - [ ] Modal, dialog, tooltip components
  - [ ] Form controls and validation
- [ ] Add storybook or component documentation
  - [ ] Set up component preview system
  - [ ] Document component APIs and usage

### 2.2 Progressive Enhancement
- [ ] Identify self-contained UI sections for conversion
  - [ ] Create component isolation map
  - [ ] Prioritize components for conversion
- [ ] Replace DOM manipulation with component instantiation
  - [ ] Create component wrappers for existing functionality
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
  - [ ] Test each converted component thoroughly
- [ ] Implement two-way state binding between old and new architectures

### 2.3 API Layer Refinement
- [ ] Create consistent API client
  - [ ] Implement fetch wrapper with error handling
  - [ ] Add request/response interceptors
  - [ ] Create typed interfaces for API responses
- [ ] Centralize API endpoint definitions
  - [ ] Create API service modules
  - [ ] Document API interfaces

## Phase 3: Framework Integration

### 3.1 Framework Selection and Setup
- [ ] Finalize framework selection
  - [ ] Create small proof-of-concept
  - [ ] Document decision criteria
- [ ] Set up framework tooling
  - [ ] Install required dependencies
  - [ ] Configure build process
  - [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Create application shell with new framework
  - [ ] Design application wrapper
  - [ ] Set up router scaffold
  - [ ] Create layout components

### 3.2 Incremental Framework Adoption
- [ ] Identify target areas for initial conversion
  - [ ] Select non-critical features
  - [ ] Create migration priority list
- [ ] Implement feature flags for toggling implementations
  - [ ] Create feature flag system
  - [ ] Add switching mechanism in UI
- [ ] Convert first feature to new framework
  - [ ] Implement parallel version
  - [ ] Test thoroughly
  - [ ] Document conversion process

### 3.3 Server-Side Integration
- [ ] Update server routes to support new frontend
  - [ ] Add API endpoints as needed
  - [ ] Ensure authentication flows work
- [ ] Implement SSR if applicable
  - [ ] Configure server for rendering
  - [ ] Test hydration
  - [ ] Optimize for performance

## Phase 4: Complete Modernization

### 4.1 Full Application Conversion
- [ ] Convert remaining features to framework components
  - [ ] Follow established patterns
  - [ ] Ensure consistent state management
- [ ] Implement proper routing system
  - [ ] Define route structure
  - [ ] Add navigation guards if needed
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading
- [ ] Add modern web capabilities
  - [ ] Service worker for offline support
  - [ ] Push notifications
  - [ ] Web app manifest

### 4.2 Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement code splitting
  - [ ] Route-based code splitting
  - [ ] Component lazy loading
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing
  - [ ] Unit tests
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Optimize for performance
  - [ ] Bundle analysis
  - [ ] Performance monitoring
  - [ ] Lazy loading optimizations

### 4.3 Documentation & Finalization
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
  - [ ] Architecture overview
  - [ ] Component library documentation
  - [ ] State management patterns
- [ ] Perform final cleanup
  - [ ] Remove deprecated code
  - [ ] Finalize build configurations
  - [ ] Document upgrade process for future changes

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- Phase: 2.1
- Current Task: Create base UI components
- Next Task: Integrate components with existing UI

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Added type="module" to ui-animations.js in index.html
- ✅ Enhanced Vite configuration for proper module resolution
- ✅ Created tsconfig.json with TypeScript support
- ✅ Created folder structure for component-based architecture
- ✅ Implemented lightweight state management system
- ✅ Created API utilities for consistent data fetching
- ✅ Created core UI components (Button, Card)
- ✅ Implemented timeline and command center components

### Notes
- Our initial focus is on setting up a proper module system while maintaining current functionality
- We're taking an incremental approach to minimize disruption
- Each completed phase will be verified with thorough testing
